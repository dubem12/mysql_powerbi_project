# A MySQL Power BI Project
This project seeks to create a new database on MySQL using forestry data files obtained from UNECE https://unece.org/forests/data-forest-products-production-and-trade#accordion_0. <br>
The files have been edited and worked on to extract useful information that could be used to answer relevant business questions based on historical data on forest products and other Forest allied products, like  roundwood, sawn wood, wood-based panels, pulp and paper for some countries. (see mid_project repositories) <br>
The unit of the  Production data for over 60 items are in volume (1000 cubic meters or metric tonnes), and trade data are available in volume and value (1000 $).  Selected countries include 40 countries in Europe, North America, Caucasus, and Central Asia..<br>
This project will attempt to connect and visualize these tables using Power BI <br>.
